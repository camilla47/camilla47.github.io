Hello World!

## Why Image Processing?

Image processing is the manipulation of digital images to extract useful information or to enhance visual quality. I was first exposed to image processing this summer at my internship. We were analyzing the composition of nuclear fuel plates (fancy pieces of metal). The raw radiography scan images were nearly solid gray. We wanted to analyze the differences in color (because that correlated to density). Blalla, used histogram qualization to enhance hte color contrast. 

Image processing covers a variety of something, enhancement of image quality, image compression, pattern recognition, remote sensing, document analysis, biology, science, astronomy, weather, computer science, research in any field, etc. 

## What's out there?

My mentor and I this summer hard coded a histogram equalization functino that scanned each image one pixel at a time. Needless to say, this took FOREVER. Then there was the fateful day we realized opencv had a built in package to do exactly what we wanted (and in like 2 seconds). Bottom line is: Know before you dig! ...wait "code"
